# credit-risk-classification
Example Logistic Regression Model used for predicting whether a loan should be considered a healthy or high-risk load based on a personâ€™s previous credit and financial history. The data was sourced from provided financial data in a csv format and split between x data and y data sets. The split x and y data was then converted into test and train x & y variables. The data was then scaled and fit into a logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a healthy or high-risk loan. The model was then tested by a confusion matrix and placed into a classification report for interpretation of accuracy and precision to determine whether the model is viable for use in real world applications.
